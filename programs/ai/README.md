## Introduction

AI, now-a-days, seems to be the best way to go...when it comes to doing coding.  

For example, I recall only recently asking: ClaudeAI...  
to write me a calculator program using a mixture of, Python3/TKInter library;  
and, in only just seconds...it outpoured all of the code.  

I simply 'copied and pasted' the code into a file called: calculator.py;  
and, then, ran it...; sure enough everything 'worked', first time.  

My mind started thinking, if I had to build that app going from total scratch;  
then, it would have taken me whole hours of Googling for this/Googling for that...?  
Most probably, building out the whole app might have taken me if not hours/  
then, at least, a couple of days.  

Yet, AI managed to achieve doing the same job...as requested...in just merely seconds.   
Wow! How totally cool is that...  

But, of course, the downside is...that the programmer's job...;   
which might have taken them long years to go and learn...;  
is now going 'out of fashion';  
as even a non-programmer can build apps themselves with AI's help.  

All a person has to learn is how to write good AI prompts;  
and, basically, that's it.
