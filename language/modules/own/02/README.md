# myMathsModule

This program consists of the following 4 files:

1> myMathsModule.py -        (the maths library, includes functions for: add, subtract, multiply, divide)  
2> callMyMathsModule.py -    (the caller program...which connects to the above file/and, makes the functions execute)  
3> runDOS.bat - (this file uses DOS Command Prompt window to call the file: [callMyMathsModule.py]/and, too, to view the program output)
4> myMathModule.png -        (shows the printout of the program in action/using Windows Command Prompt screen window to show all output)  

**NOTE**: The file: [myMathsModule.py] uses the 'return' statement inside of it's functions/as opposed to using the 'print' statement.
