# myMathsModule

This program consists of the following 2 files...

- myMathsModule.py         (the maths library, includes functions for: add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- callMyMathsModule.py     (the caller program...which connects to the above file/and, makes the functions execute)
- myMathModule.png         (shows the printout of the program in action/using Windows Command Prompt screen window to show all output)

NOTE: The file: [myMathsModule.py] uses the 'return' statement inside of it's functions/as opposed to using the 'print' statement.
