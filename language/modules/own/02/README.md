# myMathsModule

This program consists of the following 5 files:

1> myMathsModule.py -        (the maths library, includes functions for: add, subtract, multiply, divide)  
2> callMyMathsModule.py -    (the caller program...which connects to the above file/and, makes the functions execute)  
3> runDOS.bat - (this file uses DOS Command Prompt window to call the file: [callMyMathsModule.py]/and, too, to view the program output)
4> myMathModule.png -        (shows the printout of the program in action/using Windows Command Prompt screen window to show all output)  
5> README.md - (this explanatory Markdown file)  

**NOTE**: The file: [myMathsModule.py] uses the 'return' statement inside of it's functions/as opposed to using the 'print' statement.  

-----

**USAGE: Beginner's**: You only need to download the first 3 files: [myMathsModule.py]/[callMyMathsModule.py]/[runDOS.bat];    
make sure they are all stored inside of one same folder directory;     
next, left double click on the file called: runDOS.bat;    
when the black screen command window appears...type in after the prompt:   

>  C:\>callMyMathsModule.py  (then, press [ENTER] key)     

...the, program output should appear for viewing.  

-----

**USAGE: Experienced**: If you already know what you are doing...; and, wish to run the code using other Python programming environments     
such as: IDLE/Visual Studio Code/PyCharm/-etc.  
then, all you need do is just download 2 files: [myMathsModule.py]/[callMyMathsModule.py];  
and, I'm sure, you will already know exactly how to proceed from there.
