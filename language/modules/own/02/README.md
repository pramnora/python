# myMathsModule

This program consists of the following 5 files:

1> myMathsLibrary.py -        (the maths library, includes functions for: add, subtract, multiply, divide)  
2> callMyMathsLibrary.py -    (the caller program...which connects to the above file/and, makes the functions execute)  
3> runDOS.bat - (this file uses DOS Command Prompt window to call the file: [callMyMathsModule.py]/and, too, to view the program output)
4> myMathLibrary.png -        (shows the printout of the program in action/using Windows Command Prompt screen window to show all output)  
5> README.md - (this explanatory Markdown file)  

**NOTE**: The file: [myMathsLibrary.py] uses the 'return' statement inside of it's functions/as opposed to using the 'print' statement.  

-----

**USAGE: Beginner's**: You only need to download the first 3 files: [myMathsLibrary.py]/[callMyMathsLibrary.py]/[runDOS.bat];    
make sure they are all stored inside of one same folder directory;     
next, left double click on the file called: runDOS.bat;  
when the black screen DOS Command Prompt window appears...type in:  

>C:\>  
>C:\>Python callMyMathsLibrary.py  

...and, the, program output should appear for viewing. The output should display as follows...  

>3 + 2 = 5  
>3 - 2 = 1  
>3 * 2 = 6  
>3 / 2 = 1.5  


**NOTE(S)**:  

1> These instructions are only for users of Windows Operating System. (I'm currently running Windows 10 Professional OS/Operating System.)      

2> This code will **not** work...if you don't already have Python programming language set up and ready to run inside of your own Windows environment.     

3> Python programming language can be downloaded for *FREE* from:      
- https://www.python.org

**USAGE: Experienced**: If you already know what you are doing...; and, wish to run the code using other Python programming IDE/Integrated Development Environments     
such as: 

- IDLE  
- Visual Studio Code   
- PyCharm    
- etc.    

...then, all you need do is just download 2 files: [myMathsLibrary.py]/[callMyMathsLibrary.py];    
and, run the program file called: [callMyMathsLibrary.py] for it to work.
