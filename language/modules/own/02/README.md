# myMathsModule

This program consists of the following 2 python code files: [.py]/and, also, I've included a screen printout: [.png], as well;  
so, one can see what the program looks like when it's executing.  

1> myMathsModule.py -        (the maths library, includes functions for: add, subtract, multiply, divide)  
2> callMyMathsModule.py -    (the caller program...which connects to the above file/and, makes the functions execute)  
3> myMathModule.png -        (shows the printout of the program in action/using Windows Command Prompt screen window to show all output)  

**NOTE**: The file: [myMathsModule.py] uses the 'return' statement inside of it's functions/as opposed to using the 'print' statement.
