PYTHON PROGRAM CODE

Here you will find snippets of Python 3 programming code; which you are freely able to study/learn from.

-----

INTRODUCTION

Python is a FREE programming language. It comes in 2 different versions:

1> Older version: Python 2.X

Print "Hello, world!"

2> Newer version: Python 3.X

Print ("Hello, world!")

**NOTE**: It is highly recommended that you download the 'latest' version of the Python programming language which is Python: 3.x.

(Older versions of the programming language such as Python 2.x are still available to download and use with older legacy code.)

It is possible to have multiple different versions of Python installed; all up and running on the same one computer.

SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES OF LEARNING PYTHON PROGRAMMING

Python is FREE...if you have a computer internet connection...then, the downloading process is very quick, simple and easy to set up.

Python is a very highly popular programming language; therefore, there is much code you can read/study...as well as, tons of tutorial resources...in the form of books/videos/-etc.

Python uses a fairly simple and straight forwards syntax, which makes it really excellent for people who are complete 'beginners' new to programming to learn.

It also includes many advanced features, as well...such as, linking to extended libraries one can use...this make it equally appealing for more experienced: intermediate/and, even, professional programmers.

CHECK IF PIP IS INSTALLED/(Python Package Manager)  

Type into the Windows 10 taskbar search box:  
CMD  
Then, when the Command Prompt icon appears...;  
do a 'right click'...and, select:  
Run as Administrator  
Now, a 'black screen' Command Prompt window will appear ready to type further instructions into...    
Type in...  
C:\>pip  
...this should show you a list of PIP command/options...which means, congratulations, you already have PIP installed.    
But, if not...; then use the following command...  
C:\>install pip  

You can also check which version of pip is installed by doing the following...  

C:\WINDOWS\system32>pip --version  
...alternative syntax...
C:\WINDOWS\system32>pip -V    

pip 19.2.3 from c:\users\customer1\appdata\local\programs\python\python38-32\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.8)  

**NOTE**: If you have Python 3.4 or above...; then, PIP is installed by default.  

UPDATE PIP

C:\>python -m pip install --upgrade pip

C:\Users\customer1>pip --version
pip 20.1 from c:\users\customer1\appdata\local\programs\python\python38-32\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.8)

HOW TO FIND FURTHER PIP COMMANDS

C:\>pip  
...alternative syntax...  
C:\>pip --help  

HOW TO CHECK WHICH SOFTWARE PACKAGES PIP HAS ALREADY INSTALLED

C:\>pip list

HOW TO USE PIP TO INSTALL FURTHER PYTHON SOFTWARE PACKAGES

C:\>pip install numpy

HOW TO USE NUMPY INSIDE OF IDLE

>>>import numpy as np  
>>>xArrayName=np.arrange(start=1,stop=10)  
>>>xArray  
>>>array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])  
>>>x.reshape(3,3)  
>>>array[[1, 2, 3],  
         [4, 5, 6],  
         [7, 8, 9]])

CHECK IF TKINTER IS INSTALLED

TKInter, allows one to add a GUI/Graphical User Interface to Python programs...(eg, include Windows/Labels/Buttons/-etc.)  

C:\> python -m tkinter  

...a window should appear showing you which version of TKInter is installed;   
the window also contains 2 buttons: Click Me/QUIT

PYTHON TURTLE GRAPHICS

# program: turtle grahics: draw a square...

import turtle  # imports the turtle graphics library ready for drawing with

turtle.forwards(100) # draws a line moving forwards 100 pixels  
turtle.left(90)      # moves the turtle head 90 degrees/ready to draw the next line going in a different direction, instead

turtle.forwards(100) # draws a line moving forwards 100 pixels  
turtle.left(90)      # moves the turtle head 90 degrees/ready to draw the next line going in a different direction, instead

turtle.forwards(100) # draws a line moving forwards 100 pixels  
turtle.left(90)      # moves the turtle head 90 degrees/ready to draw the next line going in a different direction, instead

turtle.forwards(100) # draws a line moving forwards 100 pixels  
turtle.left(90)      # moves the turtle head 90 degrees/ready to draw the next line going in a different direction, instead
