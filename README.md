INTRODUCTION

Python is a FREE programming language. It comes in 2 different versions:

1> Older version: Python 2

Print "Hello, world!"

2> Newer version: Python 3

Print ("Hello, world!")

Here I have opted to use the newest version which is, Python 3. 

It uses a fairly simple and straight forwards syntax; which makes it excellent for beginners to learn.
