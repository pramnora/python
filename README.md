INTRODUCTION

Python is a FREE programming language. It comes in 2 different versions:

1> Older version: Python 2.X

Print "Hello, world!"

2> Newer version: Python 3.X

Print ("Hello, world!")

**NOTE**: It is highly recommended that you download the 'latest' version of the Python programming language which is Python: 3.x.

(Older versions of the programming language such as Python 2.x are still available to download and use with older legacy code.)

import turtle  # imports the turtle graphics library ready for drawing with

turtle.forwards(100) # draws a line moving forwards 100 pixels  
turtle.left(90)      # moves the turtle head 90 degrees/ready to draw the next line going in a different direction, instead

turtle.forwards(100) # draws a line moving forwards 100 pixels  
turtle.left(90)      # moves the turtle head 90 degrees/ready to draw the next line going in a different direction, instead

turtle.forwards(100) # draws a line moving forwards 100 pixels  
turtle.left(90)      # moves the turtle head 90 degrees/ready to draw the next line going in a different direction, instead
