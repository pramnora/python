# NOTE: In Python you don't need to declare the data type, first; instead, data type will be, automatically, inferred.

# python array data is enclosed inside of a pair of square brackets: [];
# and, each new data item is seperated from the next data item by the use of a comma: [,,,]
                             
num = [1,10,100,1000,10000]

# a for loop can be used to traverse through the entire array;
# the print out of each data item is achieved by using the for loop variable name

for eachArrayItemNo in num:
	print eachArrayItemNo 
	
#1
#10
#100
#1000
#10000
