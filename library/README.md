# The use of Python library codes...

One of the most remarkable strengths of the Python programming language   
is it's inclusion of all different sorts of library codes;     
of which there are two different kinds of Python library code that it's possible to access:  

1. Built-in library codes: math, os, random, string, tk, turtle, -etc. 

2. External library codes: numpy, pandas, -etc.

Some of these libraries do offer extensive capabilities of their own...;   
thus, present yet another 'learning curve' that one needs to learn/master.
