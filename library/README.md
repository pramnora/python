# The use of Python library codes...

One of the most remarkable strengths of the Python programming language is it's inclusion of library codes;   
of which there are two different kinds of Python library code that it's possible to access:  

1. Built-in library code: math, os, random, -etc. 

2. External library code: numpy, pandas, -etc.

Some of these libraries offer extensive capabilities of their own;   
so, this is another 'learning curve' that one nees to learn/master.
