One of the most remarkable strengths of the Python programming language     
is it's inclusion of all different sorts of library codes...;       
of which there are two different kinds of Python library code that it's possible to access:  

1. Built-in library codes: math, os, random, string, -etc. 

2. External library codes: numpy, pandas, tk, turtle, vpython, -etc.

Some of these libraries do offer very extensive capabilities of their own...;   
thus, presenting yet another 'learning curve' that one needs to fully learn/master.  

## How to include library codes...  

1a> If the library code is located: 'internally'; and, you wish to use it...;   
then, just simply type in at the top of the Python file, [.py]:        

>> import libraryName    
...example...  
>> import random  

2a> If the library code is located: 'externally'; and, you wish to use it...;  
then, go to your Windows DOS Command Prompt...and, type in:  

>> pip install libraryName  
...example...  
>> pip install numpy  

...and, proceed as previously mentioned above in step 1a.  

**NOTE**: If you try to import some external library code...which hasn't yet been installed;      
then, you will get an *error message* stating something like:     

>> libraryName NOT recognised...?!    

...this, quite simply, means you have to install the 'external' library, first.
