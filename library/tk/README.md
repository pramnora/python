# TKInter

Python programs: [.py], are usually run using a **CLI**/**C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface.

However, it is also possible to run Python programs using an **OOP**/**O**bject **O**riented **P**rogramming **I**nterface, instead;
by employing the TKInter code library.

TKInter includes such things as...

- Window (3 boxes: 'Expand/Hide', 'Grow/Shrink', 'Close' buttons...seen at at the top right corner on Windows platforms)
- Window title text
- Buttons
- Labels
- 2 different ways to present objects: 
-- Pack(each item is presented going one on top of the other...in a 'top...down' manner
-- or, Grid (much like a spreadsheet using numbered: rows/columns: eg. row=0,col=1)
- Events (you can create Python style functions, the which code runs when say a button is clicked
- etc.

Right now, I'm still learning how to use TKInter library...; so, I'm still very much a total 'beginner';  
therefore, my own understanding of it remains extremely 'limited' to date.

## Example codes...

A simple -(3 lines of code)- example of a minimal TKInter program is...

from tkinter import *  
root = Tk()  
root.mainloop()  

...save the above example code as being called...

>> stub.py

NOTE: If you are running the program using DOS; then, please, don't forget to use the 'Python' keyword before the program name. Eg.

>> C:> python stub.py

...then, run it using either your Python IDE/or, a DOS prompt command line window/-etc.

The program output should display...
- a window...with 3 boxes on the top right hand side: (hide/grow/close)
- a window title head text which says: TK
- also, the window size can be dragged: horizontally/vertically/diagonally...;
  used to either make the window size either expand/or, shrink. 

Warmest congratulations, welcome to the *start* of your **Python/TKInter** programming learning journey. ;-)
