# TKInter

TKInter library, presents a very useful OOP/Object Oriented Programming UI-User Interface...;   
which can be used as an alternative to the normal CLI/Command Line Interface program.  

TKInter includes such things as...
- Window (Expand/Hide,Grow/Shrink,Close buttons at the top right corner...on Windows platforms)
- Window title text
- Buttons
- Labels
- 2 different ways to present objets: Pack/or, Grid (much like a spreadsheet using numbered: rows/columns)
- Events (you can create Python style functions, the which code runs when say a button is clicked
- etc.

Right now, I'm still learning how to use TKInter library...; so, I'm still very much a 'beginner'...;  
and, therefore, my own understanding and description is, most probably, severely 'limited'.
