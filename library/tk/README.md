# TKInter

Python programs: [.py], are usually run using a **CLI**/**C**ommand **L**ine **UI**-**U**ser **I**nterface.

However, it is also possible to run Python programs using an **OOP**/**O**bject **O**riented **P**rogramming **UI**-**U**ser **I**nterface, instead;
by employing the TKInter code library.

TKInter includes such things as...

- Window (Expand/Hide,Grow/Shrink,Close buttons at the top right corner...on Windows platforms)
- Window title text
- Buttons
- Labels
- 2 different ways to present objets: Pack/or, Grid (much like a spreadsheet using numbered: rows/columns)
- Events (you can create Python style functions, the which code runs when say a button is clicked
- etc.

Right now, I'm still learning how to use TKInter library...; so, I'm still very much a total 'beginner';  
therefore, my own understanding of it remains very 'limited' to date.
