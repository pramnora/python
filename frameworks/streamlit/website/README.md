# SITE STRUCTURE/AND, PAGE ORDER    

In order to create a web site using Streamlit...;  
one has to pay careful attention how to structure your site/  
and, also, how to call/number each page:      

There should be a file called:    

> main.py  

...and, there should be a directory folder called:  

> pages  

...inside of the pages folder that's where pages are stored.  
Each page is numbered at the start...  

> 1_anyPagName.py  
> 2_anyPageName.py  
> 3_anyPagName.py  

...and, the pages will be displayed using a menu which shows that specific order.
