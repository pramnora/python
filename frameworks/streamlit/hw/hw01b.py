# NOTE: For the above example code to work...
#       type into the Linux Mint OS Terminal command:
#       streamlit run hw01.py
#       ...next, go over to your web browser software,
#       and, type in the following URL into the web browser address bar:
#       localhost:5001
#       ...the web page will load showing:
#       - a mark down size 1 heading: My first app
#       ...and, with output text below...
#       Hello, world! From Streamlit
#       You can shut the web server down by typing:
#       [CTRL]+[C]
#       NOTE: If you 'started' up your browser by calling the Python script;
#             then, automatically, it will close the web browser down.
#             If your web browser was already open with tabs before...;
#             then, everything should still remain open.
