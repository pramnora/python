## Introduction

Streamlit, is a web page framework...which allows Python developers to write web pages using just pure Python codes;  
or, in other words, you don't need to use any: HTML/CSS/Javascript.  

- You write the Streamlit code  

> import streamlit as st  
> st.write("""  
> # Test web page  
> Hello, world! From Streamlit  
> """)  

- Save the file with a [filename.py] extension: [hw01.py]    

- Run the file using command:  

> Python3 streamlit run hw01.py  

- Next, move over to your web browser software, and, type in URL:

> localhost:5001   

...and, there you will see the web browser output appear.  

In my own personal experience this has been a total *game changer* when it comes to writing web pages.
