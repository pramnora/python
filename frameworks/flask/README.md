## Introduction

Flask, is a Python framework which allows one to build web pages.

-----

## Writing/Testing/Running your 1st Flask app.  

(

>from flask import Flask  
>app = Flask(__name__)  
>@app route('/')  
>def hw():  
>return 'Hello, world! From Flask app'  
>if __name__ == __main__:  
>app.run(debug=True)

Thus, it took no more than just 7 lines of code to go create a Flask app. How totally 'cool' is that...?!  

-----  

**NOTE(S)**: 

1- The above code was tested using: PC/Linux Mint OS/Nano editor  

2- If Flask is not already installed...; you can install it by using the command:    
>pip install flask      

3. The above code was borrowed from:
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flask-creating-first-simple-application/  

4. In order to run the above code, use command:  
>Python3 flask1.py  

5. In order to see the code up and working inside of your own web browser...; go to your local host URL address:    
- http://127.0.0.1:5000  
...and, there you should witness seeing the 'output' of your very first 1st Flask web page app.  
Warmest congratulations! ;-)
