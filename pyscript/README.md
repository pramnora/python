PyScript, is a recent development in the art of building web pages...as of date: Wed 15th Feb 2023;  
I think, it was released just 2 weeks back...; and, I'm only just discovering learning about it, right now.  

Apparently, it allows Python code to be run inside of the web page...; intermixed with HTML/CSS/Javascript.    

It's similar in a way to other web browser based languages: VBScript, PearlScript, -etc.;  
but, with obvious Python capabilities...linking to Python libraries/-etc.
