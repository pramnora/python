## Introduction  

**PyScript**, is a recent development in the art of building web pages...as of date: *Wed 15th Feb 2023*;  
I think, it was released just 2 weeks back...; and, I'm only just discovering learning about it, right now.  

Apparently, it allows Python code to be run inside of the web page...; being intermixed with HTML/CSS/Javascript.    

It's similar in a way to other web browser based languages: VBScript, PearlScript, -etc.;  
but, with obvious Python capabilities...linking to Python libraries/-etc.  

What I especially like about PyScript is, I can now get to *share* my own Python code with others over the internet;  
simply, by including the scripts inside of the web pages I write; then, **publishing** it onto the net;  
and, this means that people can both *see/interact* with the code, immediately.
